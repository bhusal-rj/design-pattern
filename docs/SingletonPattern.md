# Singleton Pattern
- One of the rarely use pattern within the design pattern.
- It states that the class must have only one instance and allows to provide the same instance across all of the application.
- In programming we generally discourage the use of the global variables as many of the services within the application might accidently change the variable as they are lossely coupled within the services resulting in hard time to debug.
- One man's constant is another man's variable.
- **Always be careful when using the singleton pattern**
